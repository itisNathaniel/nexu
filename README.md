<b>To install on Mac OS X</b>
- Requires MySQL and PHP - MAMP is probably easiest
 - On MAMP when installed double click it, open 'htdocs' and paste 'nexu' there
 - Do not add bits from your database into the version that you commit as it will end badly
 - Open MAMP and press 'Open Start Page', replace '/MAMP/' with '/nexu'
 - continue through setup, open MAMP start page info for database credentials
