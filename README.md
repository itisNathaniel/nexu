<b>To install on Mac OS X</b>
- Requires MySQL and PHP - MAMP is probably easiest
 - Create a symbolic link from where your GitHub folder is for Nexu to MAMP or your webserver; for example:
     - ln -s /Users/johndoe/Documents/Repositories/nexu /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/nexu
          - (ln -s) means a Symbolic link 
          - (/Users/johndoe/Documents/Repositories/nexu) is where your Nexu repository is cloned to 
          - (/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/nexu) is where you want to link your repository to, (i.e: your MAMP web docs folder)
 - Open MAMP and press 'Open Start Page', replace '/MAMP/' with '/nexu'
 - continue through setup, open MAMP start page info for database credentials
